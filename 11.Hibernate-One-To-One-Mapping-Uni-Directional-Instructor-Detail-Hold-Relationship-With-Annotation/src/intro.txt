in case of bi-directional we can only fetch and delete data from another end which is opposite of table which holds the
relationship but we can't insert data only from that end which holds the relationship.

we only need bi-directionl to fetch and delete data from both sides not for insertion.

we use cascade type all to delete succesor row if the current row is deleted.it's opposite is
cascade={CascadeType.DETACH,CascadeType.MERGE,CascadeType.PERSIST,CascadeType.REFRESH}

Note:if we want to use cascade type of list above then we need to first set instructor column foreign
key id to null then we will only delete instructor detail data.
