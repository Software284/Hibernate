Hibernate caching improves the performance of the application by pooling the object in the cache. It is useful when we have to fetch the
same data multiple times.

There are mainly two types of caching:

First Level Cache, and
Second Level Cache
First Level Cache
Session object holds the first level cache data. It is enabled by default. The first level cache data will not be available to entire application. An application can use many session object.

Second Level Cache
SessionFactory object holds the second level cache data. The data stored in the second level cache will be available to entire application. But we need to enable it explicitely.

EH (Easy Hibernate) Cache
Swarm Cache
OS Cache
JBoss Cache
