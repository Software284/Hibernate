Hibernate Framework:-> Hibernate is a java framework that simplifies the development of a java application to interact with the database.it is an
open source,lightweight,ORM tool.hibernate implements the specifications of JPA for data persistence.

ORM Tool:-> An ORM tool simplifies the data creation, data manipulation and data access. it is a programming technique that maps the object to the
data stored in the datbase.ORM tool internally uses the JDBC API to interact with the database.

JPA:-> Java Persistence API(JPA) is a java specification that provides certain functionality and standard to ORM tools.the javax.persistence package
contains the JPA classes and interfaces.

Advantage:->
i. Open Source and Lightweight
ii. Fast Performance
iii. Database Independent Query
iv. Automatic Table Creation
v. Simplifies Complex Join
vi. Provides Query Statistics and Database Status

Element Of Hibernate Architecture:-> For creating the first hibernate application,we must know the elements of hibernate architecture.they are
as follows:
i. SessionFactory:-> The Session Factory is a factory of a session and client of ConnectionProvider. it holds second level cache(optional) of
data. the org.hibernate.SessionFactory interface provides factory method to get the object of Session.

ii. Session:-> The session object provides an interface between the application and data strored in the database.it is a short-lived object and 
wraps the JDBC connection.it is factory of a Transaction,Query and Criteria. it holds a first-level cache(mandatory) of data.
