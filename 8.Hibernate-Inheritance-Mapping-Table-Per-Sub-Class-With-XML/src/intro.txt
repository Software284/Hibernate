In case of Table Per Subclass, subclass mapped tables are related to parent class mapped table by primary key and foreign key relationship.

The <joined-subclass> element of class is used to map the child class with parent using the primary key and foreign key relation.

In this example, we are going to use hb2ddl.auto property to generate the table automatically. So we don't need to be worried about creating tables in the database.
